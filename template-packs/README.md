# Template Packs

This directory stores reusable workflow template bundles for import/export workflows.

## Files

- `starter-workflow-pack.json`: seed workflows for coding, review, and release ops.

## Usage

1. Open Templates view.
2. Use the import action.
3. Paste bundle content from a file in this folder.

Notes:

- Bundle import is additive and auto-renames duplicates.
- Trigger and schedule metadata are preserved.
- Required connector keys are validated at runtime during execution.
