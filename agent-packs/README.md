# Agent Packs

This directory stores portable agent bundle examples for import/export workflows.

## Files

- `starter-jarvis-pack.json`: baseline multi-agent roster aligned with the PRD.

## Usage

1. Open Agents view.
2. Use the import action.
3. Paste bundle content from a file in this folder.

Notes:

- Bundles are workspace-portable and additive on import.
- Import automatically de-conflicts duplicate agent names.
- Policy rules in exported bundles are included alongside agent definitions.
